Estimating crime density in South Africa using SAPS data and 2011 Census data from StatsSA
# Crime Density Estimation in South Africa

## Introduction

This project aims to estimate crime density in South Africa and showcase per capita crime data. The data required for this estimation is not readily available, so we used a combination of publicly downloadable data generated by Stats SA (Statistics South Africa) and SAPS (South African Police Service). For demographic data, we utilized the 2011 census numbers and plan to update them with the 2022 census results when available. Additionally, we analyzed crime data for the past 10 years and aggregated it into different time buckets (1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years) to observe trends.

## Data Sources

1. **Stats SA Data**:
   - We used .dta files from Stats SA, which included information for 84,907 small areas, 21,589 unique sub-places, 12,299 unique main places, 232 municipalities, 52 districts, and 9 provinces.

2. **SAPS Crime Stats**:
   - We obtained crime statistics from the SAPS website in the form of the "Crime-Statistics-2021_2022-latest.xlsx" file.
   - Using VBA code, we extracted the crime data per POLICE CLUSTER/BOUNDARY, resulting in a total of 1,158 police stations with 31 crime categories each, leading to 35,898 records per year over 10 years.
   - It was discovered that the SAPS database listed "LAERSDRIFT" twice: one in Mpumalanga and another in Limpopo. Since the Limpopo entry had all crime entries as zero and no related data, we assumed it was included in error and excluded it.

3. **Spatial Data**:
   - We downloaded shape files of boundaries at a sub-place level from Stats SA and the station boundary shape file from SAPS.
   - Geometry issues in the shape files were fixed, and the intersection of the small place and station boundary files was determined.
   - An uncertainty level was assigned based on the relationship between the small place and the number of intersecting police stations. An uncertainty rating of 0 indicates confirmation, while 1:1 and 1:10 ratios result in uncertainty ratings of 1 and 10, respectively.
   - Some police stations in the SAPS Station Boundary data had no related stats, so we ignored them.

4. **Demographic Data**:
   - Police clusters were assigned to demographic data, and the population per police cluster was calculated. This population figure allows us to estimate the rate of crime per 20,000 people, as it is similar to the estimated population in the last place where crime was experienced.

5. **Open Street Map (OSM) Data**:
   - Open Street Map places were downloaded and joined by location to our crime data.
   - Certain locations were not allocated a place on OSM, but this does not pose a problem for this project. A list of all coordinates for these places is available, and updating OSM data is planned for a future project.

## Map Layers

The map generated by this project consists of four layers:

1. **Base Layer**:
   - This layer showcases the names of towns and the geographical structure of South Africa.

2. **Police Bounds**:
   - This layer displays crimes in certain police clusters, allowing us to overlay the Stats SA data and estimate crime density or crimes per 20,000 people.

3. **Police Points**:
   - These are geographical locations of all police stations. They provide access to actual crime statistics for each police station.

4. **Small Area Bounds**:
   - These boundaries represent small areas as defined by Stats SA and are the smallest geographical units used to split communities in South Africa. We utilize this layer to display population, gender, and age data.

## Limitations and Disclaimer

Please note the following limitations and disclaimer regarding this data:

1. **Data for Decision Making**: This data should not be used for decision-making purposes as it may contain errors or inaccuracies.

2. **Estimate Accuracy**: The demographic data used for population allocation is an estimate, and there is no guarantee of complete accuracy or validity in this allocation process.

3. **Spatial Data Issues**: While we attempted to resolve geometry issues, there may still be potential discrepancies or uncertainties in the spatial data used.

4. **Missing Data**: Certain locations were not allocated a place on Open Street Map, and their data might not be available for analysis.

5. **Outdated Data**: The crime data and demographic data used in this project might become outdated over time.

## Conclusion

This project presents an estimation of crime density in South Africa using a combination of publicly available data from Stats SA and SAPS. The generated map showcases per capita crime data at different time intervals and can provide valuable insights into crime trends. However, it is essential to understand the limitations of the data and exercise caution when using it for any decision-making purposes. Future updates to demographic data and spatial data may improve the accuracy and reliability of crime density estimations in South Africa.
